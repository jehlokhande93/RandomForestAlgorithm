# RandomForestAlgorithm
Implementation of the Random Forest Algorithm from scratch in Python

There are 3 scripts for the algorithm.

Util.py: All the utility functions such as calculation of entropy, information gain and partitioning of data is done

decision_tree.py: A single decision tree is created based on the dataset in the script

random_forest.py: Test data is classified by a number of decision trees using bootstrapping on the dataset
